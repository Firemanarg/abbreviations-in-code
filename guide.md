# Guide

1. The list is sorted with alphabetical sections. With exceptions for "Numbers", "Symbols" and "Others" which are special.
2. In section, abbrs are sorted in alphabetical order.
3. Abbrs are in word-abbr format.
4. Colored circles after the abbr mean the degree of recommendation:

-  ðŸŸ¢ Recommended
-  ðŸŸ¡ Context-sensitive
-  ðŸ”´ Not recommended

Unrecommended abbrs can still be considered.
The most important thing is to remain consistent in your code.

4. Context abbrs are more suitable in certain cases. The context is specified between {} after the abbr.
