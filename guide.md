# Guide

1. The list is sorted with alphabetical sections. With exceptions for "Numbers", "Symbols" and "Others" which are special.
2. In section, abbrs are sorted in alphabetical order.
3. Abbrs are in word-abbr format.
4. Colored circles before the abbr mean the degree of recommendation:

-  ðŸŸ¢ Recommended
-  ðŸŸ¡ Context-sensitive
-  ðŸ”´ Not recommended

Unrecommended abbrs can still be considered.
The most important thing is to remain consistent in your code.

4. Context abbrs are more suitable in certain cases. The context is specified between { } after the abbr.
5. If a word has more possible abbrs they are sorted from the most recommended to the least one. If there's more of one kind it's sorted in alphabetical order.
